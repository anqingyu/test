--- Abstract Factory  
Provides one level of interface higher than the factory pattern. It is used to return one of several factories.
--- Builder
Construct a complex object from simple objects step by step.  
--- Factory Method    
Provides an abstraction or an interface and lets subclass or implementing classes decide which class or method should be
instantiated or called, based on the conditions or parameters given.  
--- Prototype  
Cloning an object by reducing the cost of creation.  
--- Singleton    
One instance of a class or one value accessible globally in an application.
Structural Patterns  
--- Adapter  
Convert the existing interfaces to a new interface to achieve compatibility and reusability of the unrelated classes
in one application. Also known as Wrapper pattern.
--- Bridge  
Decouple an abstraction or interface from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
--- Composite  
Build a complex object out of elemental objects and itself like a tree structure.
--- Decorator  
add additional features or behaviors to a particular instance of a class, while not modifying the other instances of same class
--- Facade  
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. Wrap a complicated subsystem with a simpler interface.
--- Flyweight  
Make instances of classes on the fly to improve performance efficiently, like individual characters or icons on the screen.
--- Proxy  
Use a simple object to represent a complex one or provide a placeholder for another object to control access to it.
Behavioral Patterns
--- Chain of Responsibility  
Let more than one object handle a request without their knowing each other. Pass the request to chained objects until
it has been handled.
--- Command  
Streamlize objects by providing an interface to encapsulate a request and make the interface implemented by subclasses
in order to parameterize the clients.
--- Interpreter  
Provides a definition of a macro language or syntax and parsing into objects in a program.
--- Iterator  
Define an object that encapsulates details and other objects interact with such object. The relationships are loosely decoupled.
--- Mediator  
Decouple the direct communication between objects by introducing a middle object, the mediator, that facilitates the communication
between the objects.
--- Memento
To record an object internal state without violating encapsulation and reclaim it later without knowledge of the original object.
--- Observer
One object changes state, all of its dependents are updated automatically.
--- State
An object's behavior change is represented by its member classes, which share the same super class.
--- Strategy
Group several algorithms in a single module to provide alternatives. Also known as policy.
--- Template Method
Provide an abstract definition for a method or a class and redefine its behavior later or on the fly without changing its structure.
--- Visitor
Define a new operation to deal with the classes of the elements without changing their structures.


### 建造者模式（Builder Pattern）
 将一个复杂对象的创建与它的表述分离，使得同样的构造过程可以创建不同的表示。
